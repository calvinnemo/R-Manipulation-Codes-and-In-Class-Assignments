# In Class Assignment from Class 4 - R Functions code given by Ram sir 

#Assignment 3

# Create a dataset of Custs
#                    ID as distinct numerical values
#                    Income is normal distribution M: 250,000 and SD:75000
#                    Gender 60% are Male in the sample (Hint runif and ifelse)

#Start

# Income is Normal distribution
normal_income <- rnorm (10, mean=250000, sd= 75000)
View(normal_income)
mean(normal_income)

# Creating ID as distinct numerical values
cust.id<- c(1:100)
income <- rnorm(cust.id, mean = 250000, sd= 75000)
View(income)
sd(income)

#repeat function is used to repeat the same values in a vector
gender<-c(rep("F",100))
j<-sample(1:100,100,replace=FALSE) #It will create 100 integers but not unique if we don't write FALSE

#FOR LoOP- if you have to repeat a condition until the result is met

for(q in 1:100)
  if(gender[j[q]]=="F"&& q<=40){}
  else{
    gender[j[q]<-c("M")]
  }
  
  #End
